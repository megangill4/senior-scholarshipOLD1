## Introduction

Understanding the bonding in chemical compounds enables chemists to predict reactions and properties of different molecules. Conjugated organic compounds (typically represented as containing alternating single and double bonds) in particular display interesting properties. Conjugated compounds are a common presence in everyday life. Below is the structure of beta-carotene, responsible for the orange colour of carrots:

# Note on skeletal formulae
Throughout this website, I will represent molecules using skeletal formulae. In skeletal formulae, carbon atoms are represented as points and carbon-hydrogen bonds are not shown. All other atoms are shown. These structures are most useful because they are quickly represented while still displaying important parts of the molecule.
E.g. ethanol:

```

```{image} images/ethanol_s.png
:alt: ethanol_2
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 350px
:align: right
```

While conjugated compounds are typically represented as having alternating single and double bonds, this is not a true representation of the bonding in these compounds. In fact, the double bonds are delocalised across the whole conjugated system, increasing the stability of the molecule.
