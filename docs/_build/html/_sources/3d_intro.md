## 3D Probability Distributions

Now that we have both the spherical harmonics and the radial distribution functions, we can build our atomic orbitals. Atomic orbitals are simply the product of both of these functions:

The result is a 3d probability distribution. 3d probability distributions can be difficult to display. If we are only displaying the probability of events in 1d (e.g. a distribution of heights or test scores) or 2d, we can simply add an additional dimension that represents the probability of the event at each point. Unfortunately, we are not able to comprehend four dimensions, so when sampling a 3d probability distribution we cannot simply add an additional dimension. Instead, we resort to sampling the distribution in order to produce a scatter plot, or alternatively represent the region in which a specified proportion (e.g. 90%) of the events lie. On the following pages, I have outlined my approach to each method (one scatter plot and one 90% plot). I think both have their merits and uses. The scatter plot more accurately represents how probability in atomic orbitals is distributed, and the 90% plot is easier to understand in three dimensions.
