## Building Atomic Orbitals

In order to build visual representations of molecular orbitals, I first needed to consider atomic orbitals. Atomic orbitals are mathematical functions that describe a region of space around a nucleus in which there is a high probability of finding an electron, or a pair of electrons.

Atomic orbitals are described by three quantum numbers: 

Primary quantum number (n) – this describes the shell (energy level) that the orbital sits in

Angular momentum quantum number (l) – this describes the subshell the orbital is part of (e.g. s (l = 0), p (l = 1)

Magnetic quantum number (m) – this describes a specific orbital within a subshell

In order to describe an atomic orbital, two mathematical functions must be considered: the spherical harmonics and the radial distribution functions.
